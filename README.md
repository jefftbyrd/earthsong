After choosing a point on the globe, Earthsong finds sounds recorded nearby and teleports the user to the Earthsong Sound Portal, a spatial sonic playground where they can audition, manipulate and mix sounds to create their own sonic environment.

## Features

- Explore distant places through sound.
- Spatial sound player provides an intuitive way of visualizing sounds and positioning them in the stereo field.
- Special sound playback features: reverse direction, change playback speed.
- Create your own Earthsong account.
- Save snapshots of your favorite journeys and return to them later.
